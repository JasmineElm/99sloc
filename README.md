# 99sloc

Short scripts that make, arrange, package noise into something approaching music, using tools such as 

+ [sox]()
+ [youtube-dl]()
+ [imagemagick]()

The goals of this project are 

1. Create a suite of robust scripts that can automate music generation.
2. Keep scripts under 99 sloc, and use readily available tools


The scripts within this project can be categorised into three major categories: [Arrangers](#Arrangers), [Makers](#Makers), and [Packagers](#Packagers)

## Arrangers

+ [micromontage.sh](micromontage.sh) rearranges slices from a soundfile into a new one


## Makers

+ [downloadsound.sh](downloadsound.sh) downloads sound from online videos

## Packagers
